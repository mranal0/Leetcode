# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions by Mranal

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions** repository! ✨  
Here I upload my solutions to various **LeetCode problems** that I solve regularly.  

This repository contains all of my **LeetCode problem solutions**, stored in a single folder:

<!-- activity graph heroku-app end -->
## 🔍 How to Use
- All problems are inside the **`Solutions/`** folder.  
- File names usually match the problem title (underscores instead of spaces).  
- Use the search bar on GitHub to quickly find a problem by name.  

## 📈 View Changes & Track Progress
Want to see what's new or track your progress? Use the built-in change viewer:

```bash
# View recent changes (last 7 days)
python3 view_changes.py

# View changes from last 30 days  
python3 view_changes.py --recent 30

# Show solution statistics
python3 view_changes.py --stats

# List all solutions
python3 view_changes.py --list
```

You can also check the **`CHANGELOG.md`** file for a detailed history of all additions and updates! 📝
